== Description ==

Use your WordPress media library to generate a responsive, scrolling gallery with this section.

To use simply place the section in a page template, upload media using WordPress' media uploader and set options. That's pretty much it. It couldn't be any easier. 

<strong>To Use:</strong>
1. Upload some images using the standard Wordpress image uploader on any post or page. Don't worry about any of the settings, those won't be used.
2. Insert the gallery on the corresponding page template using drag/drop.
3. Choose a layout, but this is optional, as the layout will default to thumbnails on the bottom.
4. Have some coffee.
