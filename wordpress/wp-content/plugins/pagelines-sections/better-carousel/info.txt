<h3>Features</h3>
<strong>Fully Responsive</strong> built for mobile with native swipe touches and a completely responsive nature. Great for mobile devices and tablets.

<strong>Thumbnail Sources</strong> instantly stream images from Flickr with no additional plugins, or posts from multiple categories. You can also list custom post types, and can use it with NextGen gallery for a cool portfolio effect.
