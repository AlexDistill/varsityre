== Description ==

The Letters section is designed to replace your blog or other 'content' pages with a simple, and extremely readable long form content section. 

Classic typography rules state geographic rules such as proportional line heights, font-sizes and line widths. The Letters section is designed to play by these rules and make for extremely readable, no-distraction content.

<strong>To Use:</strong>
1. Replace the 'content' section on any page template (especially blog!)
2. Done!
Bonus: Preview your new section by viewing that page template, etc..
